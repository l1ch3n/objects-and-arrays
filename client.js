// An array in javascript is the collection of multiple types of data at a single place in order, and an array of objects in javascript is a collection of homogenous data(drawn from a single population), that stores a sequence of numbered objects at a single place - Definition form scaler.com

//Example from scaler.com

// let myArr = [
//   {
//    studenName: "jack",
//    studenClass: 6,
//    studenSection: "a"
//   },
//   {
//    studenName: "tom",
//    studenClass: 6,
//    studenSection: "a"
//   }
// ];

// console.log(myArr[1]);

//Output from scaler.com

// {
//   studenName: "tom",
//   studenClass: 6,
//   studenSection: "a"
//  }

 //Above, there is an array of objects myArr and we are accessing an object from the array by using array index myArr[1], also printing the value on the console. As result, we are printing an object from an array of objects. This prints all the key-value pairs present at that particular index.

 // To create an array of objects in javascript, we have to declare an empty array first and then initialize it with the objects separated by a comma. - from scaler.com
